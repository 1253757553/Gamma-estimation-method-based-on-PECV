This is an additional material to demonstrate the feasibility of the fitting plane operation:

paper:
  Song Zhang: "Flexible and high-accuracy method for uni-directional structured light system calibration".
  
sentence:
  "We fit the unwrapped phase with smooth surface polynomials along ùë¢ and ùë£ directions using a smooth surface described as"
  \begin{equation}
  \Phi^{f}(u, v)=\sum_{i=0}^{5} \sum_{j=0}^{5-i} g_{i j} u^{i} v^{j}
  \end{equation}
  
Here, in order to obtain a more ideal phase for system calibration, he fitted the quintic surface.
Although the fitting operation he used is to remove the influence of other factors on the phase, the operation will involve the whole plane (calibration plate) while we use a small area. And the ideal phase for system calibration, which requires higher accuracy.
