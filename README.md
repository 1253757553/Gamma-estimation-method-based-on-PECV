# Gamma-estimation-method-based-on-PECV

'unwrap_phase.m' is a function of unwrap the phase;
'FittingPlane.m' is the result of real experiment, which is used to verify the fitting accuracy;
'ContrastExperiment.m' is the results of real experiment and simulation, which is used to verify the correction result;

'fitpatterns' is the datas of 'FittingPlane.m';
'guesspattens' is the datas of 'ContrastExperiment.m', which is used to estimate the gamma value;
'finalresults' is the datas of 'ContrastExperiment.m',  which is used to compare the correction results;
